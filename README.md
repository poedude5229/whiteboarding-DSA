# Here's my directory I'm practicing data structures and algorithms in! Why, you might ask?

## I'm two months deep in my job search and doing this for interview practice.

- Despite my only interests really being a frontend developer, companies seem to want me to solve totally irrelevant algorithm problems.

## You might say "That's dumb!" and you would be correct!

- I use code to build backends for APIs sometimes, but most of my work is distributed across frontends.

## So how does this translate to web development if all my code pertains to creating applications?

- It really doesn't! Thanks for asking all these questions. I don't know why you'd be looking through this repository, but this is just a README. It can't stop you!
